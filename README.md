# gift-card-app
App to demonstrate CQRS &amp; ES based on Spring Boot and Axon

### What is the cqrs pattern ? 

**CQRS** stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation is a design pattern that aims to separate the Read and Write operations.

* Queries: a Read only operation - no state is updated after executing queries
* Commands: a Writing operation - state is updated after executing commands


### What is the Event Sourcing Pattern ?
Event Sourcing aims to persist the state of a business entity as a sequence of state-changing events. Every action performed on a business entity should be persisted. The application reconstructs an entityâ€™s current state by replaying the events

### Axon Server
We will use Axon Server to be our Event store and our dedicated command, event and query routing solution.

As an Event Store, it gives us the ideal characteristics required when storing events.

As a Message Routing solution, it gives us the option to connect several instances together without focusing on configuring things like a RabbitMQ or a Kafka topic to share and dispatch messages.
